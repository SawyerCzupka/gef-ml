## PART II: ENABLING ACTIVITY JUSTIFICATION

---

A. ENABLING ACTIVITY

BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT

(Provide brief information about projects implemented since a country became party to the convention and results achieved):

Mali ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on December 28th, 1994; and the Kyoto Protocol on March 28th, 2002. The Ministry of Environment, Sanitation and Sustainable development (MEADD) is responsible for implementing the Convention through the Agency of Environment and Sustainable Development (AEDD) which constitutes the focal point to the Convention and with a coordination role that seeks to promote the full integration of environmental issues into different national development programs, policies and strategies. AEDD also coordinates and monitors the implementation of the different Conventions and international treaties ratified by Mali with respect to environmental sustainability issues such as combating desertification, addressing climate change and preserving biodiversity.

In the past decades, Mali faced serious environmental problems such as severe drought, desertification, rainfall variability and more which affected a lot the living environment and natural resources. In this context, the Government of Mali has adopted a National Policy of Environmental Protection, followed by the creation of AEDD for better coordination amongst the different policies and strategies on climate changes and related issues.

Since then AEDD has facilitated the development of two National Communications to the UNFCCC and actually is developing the Third National Communication, undertaking the procedures and making the arrangements needed to provide continuity to the process.

In that context, the country received assistance of the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) through the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) as the GEF implementing agency.

Mali’s First National Communication was submitted to the Conference of the Parties on November 13th, 2000, the Second National Communication on May 4th, 2012 and actually the Third National Communication, whose inventory uses 2010 as baseline, is under development with the financial assistance of the GEF and UNDP as GEF implementing agency.

Mali is working through AEDD to implement the different national policies on climate change by strengthening the capacity of stakeholders involved in natural resources management. Also, by taking actions against desertification, climate change and sustainable development through the development of information media, education and communication, sessions of training, information and awareness.

Besides the AEDD, we have the National Council of Environment, created in July 2010, which is an advisory body that mainly advises and makes proposals and recommendations on issues related to the environment.

Moreover, the climate committee was created in 2011 to function as a new forum for the cross-sectorial issues and actions to be undertaken by public and private institutions in the field of mitigation and adaptation to climate change. It is also the body that validates the different reports produced by AEDD on climate changes.

The National Strategy on Climate Change was published in 2011 in conjunction with about 148 actions on adaptation, mitigation, capacity building, and finance in 8 priority sectors all under the coordination of AEDD. This National Plan is the strategic framework that identifies the actions and measures that society and the socioeconomic sectors will have to implement to adapt to climate change and climate variability, as well as the efforts required to mitigate the greenhouse gas emissions, and build human and institutional capacity.

## In this new national and international framework, and to fulfill the new obligations from the Cancun and Durban COP decisions related to the submission of national communications and biennial update reports, support from the Global Environment Facility is needed to continue to develop and consolidate the existing technical and institutional capacity and to continue the efforts of integrating climate change into national policies, plans and program.

Mali’s First Biennial Update Report will provide an update of the country’s most recent submitted national communication, namely the second one, and particularly will build on the pertinent components of Third National Communication. The First BUR is planned to be submitted to the UNFCCC in December 2018.

## GEF 6 Enabling Activity Template for Agency Sept2015

## B. ENABLING ACTIVITY

The long term objective of the project is to reinforce capacity of Mali in the implementation of its National policy of climate change also developing its capacity to integrate climate change into national and sectorial development goals.

## GOALS, OBJECTIVES, AND ACTIVITIES

The immediate objective of the project is to assist Mali in the preparation and submission of its First Biennial Update Report to the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC for the fulfillment of its obligations to the Convention under Dec. 1/CP. 16 par. 60 and Dec 2/CP. 17 par. 41 and its Annex III.

The project expected outcomes are:

- A- Updated national circumstances and institutional arrangements relevant to the preparation of the biennial report and the national communications.
- B- National GHG Inventory with 2015 as the baseline year, using 2006 IPCC methodologies.
- C- Mali’s National Mitigation framework described including emission scenarios, mitigation scenarios, NAMAs and other mitigation actions.
- D- An assessment of the constraints, gaps and related technology, financial and capacity needs.
- E- Monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) of mitigation actions.
- F- Local capacity building for the preparation of GHG inventories, mitigation and MRV.
- G- The publication and submission of the First Biennial Update Report.

These Project outcomes are in line with the GEF’s climate change mitigation objective CCM3 under GEF-6: Foster Enabling Conditions to Mainstream Mitigation Concerns into Sustainable Development Strategies, Program 5: Integrate findings of Convention obligations and enabling activities into national planning processes and mitigation targets.

The Agency of Environment and Sustainable development is responsible for the implementation of the Third National Communications and Biennial Update Report together with a number of mitigation projects already implemented or being implemented. These projects generated a valuable dataset relevant to the mitigation chapter to the first BUR. Thus, the coordination of the above projects among many others has contributed to the institutional strengthening process, making AEDD a competent and knowledgeable implementing partner. In all projects, AEDD has considered the participation of the different relevant stakeholders including Mali’s Climate Committee Network which is composed of more than 100 key stakeholders composed of academia, private companies, government institutions and civil society, NGOs, among others, and acts as a decision body. At local level and regional levels, there is a local consultation framework involving communities and other relevant stakeholders into the climate change committee and the Mali Climate Committee Network.

The integration of the different sectors strengthens the institutional and technical capacity of the different stakeholders and institutions, not limited to a reduced group of experts and decision makers from the governmental institution where lies the responsibility for the fulfillment of the national obligations to the Convention.

The Ministry of Environment, Sanitation and Sustainable Development through AEDD performs a leadership and coordination role for the development of those actions needed for the application of the Convention and its formal communication to the international community, acting in coordination with the other stakeholders, integrating climate change in the ongoing national activities for the achievement of results to be reported and communicated through the National Communications and Biennial Update Reports.

The key stakeholders involved in the project comprise different institutions and organizations, with different roles and levels of integration/participation.

As stated above, The Ministry of Environment through AEDD will act as the Implementing Partner/Executing Agency and will be in charge of the project coordination.

Relevant Ministries, such as the Ministry of Agriculture, Energy and Water, Forest and Transport, play a key role in the elaboration of the National GHG Inventories, as they provided information and data on the estimation of the respective sectorial emissions.

In the development of the mitigation actions, an important role is played by the Ministry of Agriculture and Energy, Urban habitation, National Institutes of Statistics in particular regarding assumptions related to sector-specific mitigation plans and in updating the baseline scenario, based on the newest available data (reference scenario), as well as for the NAMAs identification and preparation for its inclusion in the National Registry and its submission to the UNFCCC.

AEDD will take part in capacity building activities for identification, preparation, and implementation of mitigation actions for GHG emissions in key agriculture, forest, transport, and energy sectors. Relevant other sectorial ministries and bodies will participate in capacity building and strengthening activities aimed at the identification, preparation, and implementation of mitigation actions for GHG emissions in key economic sectors.

## The Mali Climate Change committee, which is a multi-actor body, includes NGOs and civil society and the National Council on Environment will play an important role as a consultation committee.

## Climate Change and Vulnerable Communities

Climate change is a phenomenon that especially affects the vulnerable people and communities with scarce resources such as women, children, and others. Component F aims to focus on capacity building and full involvement of these vulnerable communities in the preparation and implementation of local initiatives on climate change. Understanding how the different social roles and economic status of men and women are affected differently by climate change will improve actions taken to adapt to and mitigate climate change.

## Institutional Framework for Project Implementation

Describe the Enabling Activity and Institutional Framework for Project Implementation: AEDD will be the executing and operational unit responsible for coordinating and implementing project activities for the preparation of the Biennial Update Report. The Government will provide in-kind support to the project, including technical experts, office equipment, conference premises, and office space. UNDP Mali will provide technical and in-kind support as well.

Activities for Project Implementation: The UNDP Mali will be the GEF Implementing Agency for the project, providing administrative support, budgetary and financial monitoring, and continuous technical support through its international climate change advisor.

## National Circumstances

A description of the national development priorities and relevant national circumstances will be provided. This outcome will address the new institutional arrangement in Mali for environmental issues, particularly climate change. It will also provide information on geographical details, economic growth, social characteristics, climate parameters, relevant policies, projects, and programs.

The specific sectors such as agriculture, forestry, ecosystems, water resources, energy, and health will be addressed to analyze how national circumstances may affect Mali's ability to deal with climate change mitigation and adaptation.

Information on institutional arrangements relevant to the preparation of national communications and biennial update reports will also be updated as part of this outcome.

## GHG National Inventories

## Mali is preparing a 3rd national GHG inventory with 2011 as the reference year, to be finalized by December 2017. Previous inventories will be reviewed using the methodology described in the 2006 Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories of the IPCC, considering the national circumstances.

## As part of this project

The 2015 Inventory will be developed using the 2006 Guidelines. The Inventory will be prepared by using mostly Tier-1 methodologies, as specified in the revised IPCC Guidelines, given that Tier-2 and Tier-3 methodologies are highly data intensive and the Mali national data are generally scanty to support these methodologies. However, efforts will be made to incorporate Tier-2 and -3 in specific cases where more detailed data and statistics are available. Therefore, the appropriate tier-level will be decided upon during the project inception in consultation with the key sectoral institutions and other government offices, which generate and manage relevant data.

The inventory for the BUR will use the same methodologies, including assumptions and data sources that are being used for the GHG inventory of the ongoing TNC to ensure the necessary consistency and comparability. This will include using the same emission factors in the different sectors.

The main activities to be undertaken for this component are:

| 1.  | Set up new institutional arrangements to mobilize a Core Inventory Team involving sector-specific experts. Develop a work program for the GHG inventory preparation.                                                                                                |

## Mitigation actions

Based on the analysis and results from the INC and SNC, Mali is a net GHG sink, due to the land-use and forestry sectors. However, in order to avoid that Mali becomes a net emitter in the future, climate mitigation actions should be taken.

Although mitigation of GHGs is not a major priority for Mali, as a low-emitting country, there is scope for action, particularly when win-win mitigation options are available. In this context, the country should try to optimize its development process towards a low-carbon intensity society without compromising its economic objectives and goals. Some institutions like the National Centre of Solar Energy and Renewable Energy, the Malian Agency for Rural Electrification and Domestic Energy have presented such win-win mitigation initiatives, (a number of projects by the Government, NGOs and of Private sector), which were highlighted in the INC and SNC. Identifying the low-cost options for reducing the carbon intensity of the economy and designing effective interventions is crucial to maintaining the position of Mali as a sink.

## With the goal of implementing national appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs) in the context of sustainable development and national development priorities, Mali has proposed to establish several NAMAs in Agriculture, Energy, Forest, transport and Urban sanitation sectors, in order to identify existing or potential national actions and its submission to the UNFCCC. Mali also planned to develop the Mali NAMA framework. The results of these initiatives will be incorporated into the BUR.

A description of all mitigation actions undertaken in Mali and a description of the national arrangements to enable the implementation of the Mali NAMA framework will be included in this report.

Financial, Technology and capacity building needs and support received.

Financial needs and constraints in order to adopt climate change measures and strategies evaluated as national priorities will be described. Updated information on financial resources, technology transfer, capacity building and technical support received from the GEF, developed country parties and multilateral organizations for activities related to climate change will be provided.

Monitoring, Reporting and Verification

An assessment will be conducted regarding the different options and possibilities for the MRV according to the guidelines to be developed, considering national circumstances and capabilities, as well as taking into account the different nature of the mitigation actions. This would include the kind of information and institutional coordination that would be needed to set up a domestic MRV system in Mali. The chapter will also identify the challenges and capacity building needs to design and establish such an MRV system.

Finally, a report will be prepared describing the framework for an MRV domestic system and the institutional arrangements that would be required to implement such MRV system.

National capacity building

This component of the BUR will provide information on past and ongoing initiatives to integrate climate change in the national planning process, information on research programmes related to impact and adaptation, initiatives on climate change education, training and public awareness and finally the status of information and networking.

Workshops and training sessions will be organized to create capacity in public, scientific and technological institutions, educational and civil society institutions. The training will also be designed for assisting local governments in integrating CC in their planning processes.

The introduction of a module on CC at Faculty of Sciences and technology in Mali will be facilitated.

Compilation, Publication and Submission of the First Biennial Update Report

The First Biennial Update Report document will be compiled according to the guidelines contained in Annex II of Dec. 2. CP 17 and it will be submitted to the Conference of the Parties in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change according to the requirements and formats established by the UNFCCC Secretariat.

D. DESCRIBE, IF N/A POSSIBLE, THE EXPECTED COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROJECT:

## GEF 6 Enabling Activity Template for Agency Sept2015

E. DESCRIBE THE BUDGETED M&E PLAN:

A Project Inception Workshop will be held within the first 2 months of project start with those with assigned roles in the project organization structure, UNDP country office and where appropriate/feasible regional technical policy and programme advisors as well as other stakeholders. The Inception Workshop is crucial to building ownership for the project results and to plan the first year annual work plan.

An Inception Workshop report is a key reference document and must be prepared and shared with participants to formalize various agreements and plans decided during the meeting.

Quarterly:

- Progress made shall be monitored in the UNDP Enhanced Results Based Management Platform.
- Based on the initial risk analysis submitted, the risk log shall be regularly updated in ATLAS. Risks become critical when the impact and probability are high. Note that for UNDP GEF projects, all financial risks associated with financial instruments such as revolving funds, microfinance schemes, or capitalization of ESCOs are automatically classified as critical on the basis of their innovative nature (high impact and uncertainty due to no previous experience justifies classification as critical).
- Based on the information recorded in Atlas, a Project Progress Reports (PPR) can be generated in the Executive Snapshot.
- Other ATLAS logs can be used to monitor issues, lessons learned etc... The use of these functions is a key indicator in the UNDP Executive Balanced Scorecard.

Bi-annual progress:

- Status Survey Questionnaires to indicate progress and identify bottlenecks as well as technical support needs will be carried out twice a year.

Periodic Monitoring:

A detailed schedule of project reviews meetings will be developed by the project management, in consultation with project implementation partners and stakeholder representatives and incorporated in the Project Inception Report. Such a schedule will include: (i) tentative time frames for Steering Committee Meetings, (or relevant advisory and/or coordination mechanisms) and (ii) project related Monitoring and Evaluation activities.

Day to day monitoring of implementation progress will be the responsibility of the Project Coordinator, Director or CTA (depending on the established project structure) based on the project's Annual Work plan and its indicators. The Project Team will inform the UNDP-CO of any delays or difficulties faced during implementation so that the appropriate support or corrective measures can be adopted in a timely and remedial fashion.

Periodic monitoring of implementation progress will be undertaken by the UNDP-CO through quarterly meetings with the project proponent, or more frequently as deemed necessary. This will allow parties to take stock and to troubleshoot any problems pertaining to the project in a timely fashion to ensure smooth implementation of project activities.

End of Project:

## During the last three months, the project team will prepare the Project Terminal Report. This comprehensive report will summarize the results achieved (objectives, outcomes, outputs), lessons learned, problems met and areas where results may not have been achieved. It will also lay out recommendations for any further steps that may need to be taken to ensure sustainability and replicability of the project’s results.
