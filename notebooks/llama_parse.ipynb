      "\n",
      "BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT\n",
      "\n",
      "(Provide brief information about projects implemented since a country became party to the convention and results achieved):\n",
      "\n",
      "Mali ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on December 28th, 1994; and the Kyoto Protocol on March 28th, 2002. The Ministry of Environment, Sanitation and Sustainable development (MEADD) is responsible for implementing the Convention through the Agency of Environment and Sustainable Development (AEDD) which constitutes the focal point to the Convention and with a coordination role that seeks to promote the full integration of environmental issues into different national development programs, policies and strategies. AEDD also coordinates and monitors the implementation of the different Conventions and international treaties ratified by Mali with respect to environmental sustainability issues such as combating desertification, addressing climate change and preserving biodiversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past decades, Mali faced serious environmental problems such as severe drought, desertification, rainfall variability and more which affected a lot the living environment and natural resources. In this context, the Government of Mali has adopted a National Policy of Environmental Protection, followed by the creation of AEDD for better coordination amongst the different policies and strategies on climate changes and related issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since then AEDD has facilitated the development of two National Communications to the UNFCCC and actually is developing the Third National Communication, undertaking the procedures and making the arrangements needed to provide continuity to the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that context, the country received assistance of the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) through the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) as the GEF implementing agency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mali’s First National Communication was submitted to the Conference of the Parties on November 13th, 2000, the Second National Communication on May 4th, 2012 and actually the Third National Communication, whose inventory uses 2010 as baseline, is under development with the financial assistance of the GEF and UNDP as GEF implementing agency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mali is working through AEDD to implement the different national policies on climate change by strengthening the capacity of stakeholders involved in natural resources management. Also, by taking actions against desertification, climate change and sustainable development through the development of information media, education and communication, sessions of training, information and awareness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides the AEDD, we have the National Council of Environment, created in July 2010, which is an advisory body that mainly advises and makes proposals and recommendations on issues related to the environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, the climate committee was created in 2011 to function as a new forum for the cross-sectorial issues and actions to be undertaken by public and private institutions in the field of mitigation and adaptation to climate change. It is also the body that validates the different reports produced by AEDD on climate changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The National Strategy on Climate Change was published in 2011 in conjunction with about 148 actions on adaptation, mitigation, capacity building, and finance in 8 priority sectors all under the coordination of AEDD. This National Plan is the strategic framework that identifies the actions and measures that society and the socioeconomic sectors will have to implement to adapt to climate change and climate variability, as well as the efforts required to mitigate the greenhouse gas emissions, and build human and institutional capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this new national and international framework, and to fulfill the new obligations from the Cancun and Durban COP decisions related to the submission of national communications and biennial update reports, support from the Global Environment Facility is needed to continue to develop and consolidate the existing technical and institutional capacity and to continue the efforts of integrating climate change into national policies, plans and program.\n",
      "---\n",
      "Mali’s First Biennial Update Report will provide an update of the country’s most recent submitted national communication, namely the second one, and particularly will build on the pertinent components of Third National Communication. The First BUR is planned to be submitted to the UNFCCC in December 2018.\n",

      "The Agency of Environment and Sustainable development is responsible for the implementation of the Third National Communications and Biennial Update Report together with a number of mitigation projects already implemented or being implemented. These projects generated a valuable dataset relevant to the mitigation chapter to the first BUR. Thus, the coordination of the above projects among many others has contributed to the institutional strengthening process, making AEDD a competent and knowledgeable implementing partner. In all projects, AEDD has considered the participation of the different relevant stakeholders including Mali’s Climate Committee Network which is composed of more than 100 key stakeholders composed of academia, private companies, government institutions and civil society, NGOs, among others, and acts as a decision body. At local level and regional levels, there is a local consultation framework involving communities and other relevant stakeholders into the climate change committee and the Mali Climate Committee Network.\n",
      "\n",
      "The integration of the different sectors strengthens the institutional and technical capacity of the different stakeholders and institutions, not limited to a reduced group of experts and decision makers from the governmental institution where lies the responsibility for the fulfillment of the national obligations to the Convention.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ministry of Environment, Sanitation and Sustainable Development through AEDD performs a leadership and coordination role for the development of those actions needed for the application of the Convention and its formal communication to the international community, acting in coordination with the other stakeholders, integrating climate change in the ongoing national activities for the achievement of results to be reported and communicated through the National Communications and Biennial Update Reports.\n",

      "Mali is preparing a 3rd national GHG inventory with 2011 as the reference year, to be finalized by December 2017. Previous inventories will be reviewed using the methodology described in the 2006 Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories of the IPCC, considering the national circumstances.\n",
      "---\n",
      "## As part of this project\n",
      "\n",
      "The 2015 Inventory will be developed using the 2006 Guidelines. The Inventory will be prepared by using mostly Tier-1 methodologies, as specified in the revised IPCC Guidelines, given that Tier-2 and Tier-3 methodologies are highly data intensive and the Mali national data are generally scanty to support these methodologies. However, efforts will be made to incorporate Tier-2 and -3 in specific cases where more detailed data and statistics are available. Therefore, the appropriate tier-level will be decided upon during the project inception in consultation with the key sectoral institutions and other government offices, which generate and manage relevant data.\n",
      "\n",
      "The inventory for the BUR will use the same methodologies, including assumptions and data sources that are being used for the GHG inventory of the ongoing TNC to ensure the necessary consistency and comparability. This will include using the same emission factors in the different sectors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main activities to be undertaken for this component are:\n",

      "## Mitigation actions\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the analysis and results from the INC and SNC, Mali is a net GHG sink, due to the land-use and forestry sectors. However, in order to avoid that Mali becomes a net emitter in the future, climate mitigation actions should be taken.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although mitigation of GHGs is not a major priority for Mali, as a low-emitting country, there is scope for action, particularly when win-win mitigation options are available. In this context, the country should try to optimize its development process towards a low-carbon intensity society without compromising its economic objectives and goals. Some institutions like the National Centre of Solar Energy and Renewable Energy, the Malian Agency for Rural Electrification and Domestic Energy have presented such win-win mitigation initiatives, (a number of projects by the Government, NGOs and of Private sector), which were highlighted in the INC and SNC. Identifying the low-cost options for reducing the carbon intensity of the economy and designing effective interventions is crucial to maintaining the position of Mali as a sink.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the goal of implementing national appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs) in the context of sustainable development and national development priorities, Mali has proposed to establish several NAMAs in Agriculture, Energy, Forest, transport and Urban sanitation sectors, in order to identify existing or potential national actions and its submission to the UNFCCC. Mali also planned to develop the Mali NAMA framework. The results of these initiatives will be incorporated into the BUR.\n",
      "---\n",
      "A description of all mitigation actions undertaken in Mali and a description of the national arrangements to enable the implementation of the Mali NAMA framework will be included in this report.\n",
      "\n",
      "Financial, Technology and capacity building needs and support received.\n",
      "\n",
      "Financial needs and constraints in order to adopt climate change measures and strategies evaluated as national priorities will be described. Updated information on financial resources, technology transfer, capacity building and technical support received from the GEF, developed country parties and multilateral organizations for activities related to climate change will be provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "Monitoring, Reporting and Verification\n",
      "\n",
      "An assessment will be conducted regarding the different options and possibilities for the MRV according to the guidelines to be developed, considering national circumstances and capabilities, as well as taking into account the different nature of the mitigation actions. This would include the kind of information and institutional coordination that would be needed to set up a domestic MRV system in Mali. The chapter will also identify the challenges and capacity building needs to design and establish such an MRV system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, a report will be prepared describing the framework for an MRV domestic system and the institutional arrangements that would be required to implement such MRV system.\n",
      "\n",
      "National capacity building\n",
      "\n",
      "This component of the BUR will provide information on past and ongoing initiatives to integrate climate change in the national planning process, information on research programmes related to impact and adaptation, initiatives on climate change education, training and public awareness and finally the status of information and networking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Workshops and training sessions will be organized to create capacity in public, scientific and technological institutions, educational and civil society institutions. The training will also be designed for assisting local governments in integrating CC in their planning processes.\n",
