9700,Finance,"The project experienced significant delays and changes, especially early in its implementation. This was partly due to the implementing ministry’s unfamiliarity with World Bank procedures leading to major delays in the recruitment of the PIU in 2013 and challenges faced in mobilizing government counterpart funding starting in 2014. The delays were also due to the number and complexity of the activities to be implemented. From the effectiveness of the IDA credit in March 2013 until the Level 1 restructuring in October 2015, only US$2.59 million were disbursed, equivalent to less than half of the around US$6 million disbursement forecast for that period. After the elimination of the requirement for counterpart funding and simplification of the project design by the Level 1 restructuring in 2015, ISR ratings have been ‘Moderately Satisfactory’ most of the time with no negative ratings since November 2018. In addition, the project experienced implementation delays as many service providers operating in remote rural areas were unable to respect contract deadlines due to the difficult conditions of access to the project area."
