The private sector's involvement is at the level of ""Knowledge & Information Sharing"" and ""Capacity Development""."
"10464"," The project involves the private sector in several ways, indicating a significant level of private sector engagement. Firstly, under Component 1, the project aims to strengthen the capacities of various stakeholders, including private sector entities, in planning, implementing, and monitoring land use plans. This includes training for private sector representatives on environmental policies and gender mainstreaming. The project also supports the involvement of beneficiaries, including private sector organizations, in participatory processes and decision-making for developing land use plans.

Under Component 2, the project facilitates the participation of private sector stakeholders in soy and beef platforms, where they can strengthen their political, social, and economic empowerment and take part in dialogues to establish collaboration relationships among different sectors. The project also aims to improve the intensification of production in a sustainable way in selected districts, focusing on meat and soy production, which are key sectors for private sector involvement.

Furthermore, the project will develop and implement a knowledge management and communication strategy targeting implementing partners and institutional and community stakeholders, including the private sector. This strategy will promote dialogue, trust, and participation to support integrated land use planning, best practices, decoupling of the meat and soy value chains from deforestation and ecosystem restoration.

In summary, the project engages the private sector in capacity development, policy development, and knowledge & information sharing activities, with potential opportunities for finance and industry leadership. The private sector is not only a recipient of project benefits but also plays an active role in various aspects of the project, indicating a substantial level of private sector involvement."
"10428"," The private sector in this context plays a role in Category 5, which is Finance. This is evident as the private sector is expected to be involved in the import, investment, operation, and maintenance of equipment related to the unconditional NDC of Mauritania. The private sector will collaborate by providing activity data usually needed for TACCC GHG inventories and will be integrated into the national MRV system to ensure that detailed activity data from private sectors' emitting sources are tracked properly and submitted to MEDD for inclusion in the UNFCCC reports. Additionally, businesses will be informed about potential climate risks relevant for their activities, particularly in agriculture. The private sector can also contribute to an increased mobilization of financial resources and technical capabilities in the development of innovative climate services and adaptation technologies."
"10188"," The private sector is involved in the project at several levels, demonstrating a significant commitment to the project's objectives. They are engaged in knowledge and information sharing, capacity development, and finance-related activities.

In terms of knowledge and information sharing, private sector partners will collaborate to ensure that reforestation and rehabilitation activities are not undermined by commercial activities. They will also share best practices and techniques to facilitate restorative practices. Private landowners will partner in efforts to mitigate land degradation and will be recipients of public awareness and sensitization activities.

In the capacity development category, private sector actors will be actively engaged in project implementation. Commercial actors will be invited to be part of multi-stakeholder groups to design land use planning tools and plans. Private sector partners will collaborate to ensure that reforestation and rehabilitation activities are not undermined by commercial activities. They will also seek consultations and agreements with private sector entities to prevent deforestation of planted trees. Private landowners, The Energy Chamber of Trinidad and Tobago, and privately operated farmer field schools will collaborate in this regard.

Regarding finance, the private sector will contribute to the project through Public-Private Partnerships and similar financial arrangements. Private sector partnerships will be crucial in increasing consumption of agroecologically produced products, and the project will support procurement mechanisms of sustainably produced products by schools, hospitals, public agencies, partner restaurants, hotels, and supermarkets. The private sector will also establish marketing arrangements and monitor the performance of the market.

However, the document does not provide information on private sector involvement in policy development or industry leadership. Therefore, the private sector's role in these areas cannot be determined based on the provided context."
"10143"," The private sector is significantly involved in the project, playing a key role in its successful scale-up. Specifically, the project aims to set up a financing/investment support scheme to leverage private investment to support the operation and maintenance of energy efficient and safe cold chains by small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The private sector is expected to provide know-your-customer (KYC) and customer pre-due diligence (CDD) documents for the financing and investment support scheme. Two polystyrene foam companies have expressed interest in joining the project during implementation and contributing financially. Additionally, the SDG Impact Investment Programme (SIIP) will be rolled out to leverage additional private sector investment.

The private sector's role extends to policy development, as private sector entities and related associations have been contacted and engaged during the PPG phase, expressing great interest in the project's objective. Furthermore, private sector representatives are included in the project's stakeholder engagement plan and will be engaged during the implementation phase.

In terms of capacity development, the private sector is expected to benefit from the project's technical, business, and financial assistance steps, which aim to guide SMEs registered in the project's investment database. Two different financial intermediaries might be needed as subcontractors to cater to the different needs of female-owned micro businesses and SMEs.

Lastly, the private sector will contribute financially to the project, with co-financing letters indicating confirmed expected amounts, sources, and types of co-financing. The total co-financing is $9,711,000, with $1,725,600 from the Afghan National Standard Authority (ANSA) in in-kind recurrent expenditures, $1,200 from ANSA in grant investment mobilized, $243,600 from Mido Dairy Production Co. Ltd in in-kind recurrent expenditures, and $153,000 from UNIDO in grant investment mobilized, among others."
"10628"," The private sector's involvement in the project can be categorized as ""Policy Development."" This is because the private sector is being consulted as part of an intervention to develop policy products, specifically in the context of Output 1.2, which relates to recycling and waste management policies in Viet Nam and Thailand. Private sector representatives may be present in meetings or workshops organized by the project, although their views and perspectives are not explicitly stated to be considered in informing policy discussions. Additionally, there is no mention of the private sector's involvement in knowledge and information sharing, capacity development, or finance-related activities in the context provided."
"10250"," The private sector will play a significant role in the project, with a focus on making contributions to Pillar II of the GEF Private Sector Engagement Strategy.

However, the document does not provide enough information to determine if the private sector will be involved in policy development, knowledge and information sharing, or industry leadership."
"10625"," The private sector is involved in the project at the level of ""Finance."" This is because the project involves engaging with the private sector for finance and/or expertise, including through Public-Private Partnerships and similar financial arrangements. The private sector is expected to contribute financing and/or expertise to interventions initiated by another party, as the project does not indicate that the private sector is playing a leading role in the project's design and implementation."
"10232"," The private sector is significantly involved in the project as outlined in the provided context. The project includes a private sector entity, Mano Palm Oil Industries (MPOI), as a key partner. MPOI will contribute a critical private sector voice to multi-stakeholder planning processes and serve as a crucial anchor for sustainable economic activities. The company will also participate in outreach and technical support to communities in and around their oil palm concession, incorporate sustainability considerations into their operation, and contribute to market opportunities for smallholder produce.

Additionally, the project will work closely with MPOI to develop an investment prospectus for approaching potential impact investment sources, including &Green and Althelia. Company input into formulation of the business case will be valuable, as will corporate commitments including technical assistance and preferential purchasing, based on smallholder and community conformity with environmental and social standards.

This level of private sector involvement can be classified as ""Industry Leadership"" (Category 6)."
"10184"," The private sector's engagement is essential to achieve the outcomes proposed by the project and to ensure its sustainability. Financial institutions and anchor companies are key actors in promoting the engagement of the private sector. The project will enter into cooperation agreements with financial institutions to finance LDN as part of their corporate social responsibility. Financial institutions will enable mobilization of investments for LDN to finance producers' adoption of SLM/SFM practices. Private banks, the financial sector of the Popular and Solidarity Economy, and non-profit microfinance organizations are part of the process. As for anchor companies, linking smallholders with companies that have greater capacities but at the same time seek to generate an impact on their supply chain is key to maintaining the sustainability of project outcomes. Long-term relationships of mutual benefit will be encouraged as part of corporate social responsibility. Companies benefit from the guarantee of constant supply while producers benefit from stable markets. These companies include exporters, supermarket distributors, B Corp. companies, and specialized shops. In terms of private fair trade organizations, they will participate in Component 3 with trade links to allow smallholders access to national and international differentiated markets. Long-term business relations with sustainable initiatives will be encouraged, and the project will promote the implementation of Fair Trade guidelines along the value chains. Collaborative workspaces will be promoted to identify needs for strengthening value chains and work on communication with the consumers on LDN and responsible consumption (Component 4).

They will also be engaged in developing sustainable business models that have the potential to deliver mutual gains to the private sector and indigenous peoples and local communities (IPLCs). The project will invest in the capacity of IPLCs and their organizations to enter into successful partnerships with private sector actors and facilitate the development of agreements between said parties. Furthermore, the project will support and test models of Public-Private Partnership (PPP) to further engage the private sector in sustainable forest management. Specific private sector actors are mentioned, including Taylor Guitars and other companies involved in the development of sustainable value chains for ebony and ecotourism."
"10655"," The private sector is involved at the level of ""Industry Leadership"" in the provided context. This is evident in the SGP's aim to enhance its engagement with the private sector through various strategies, such as developing a private sector strategy, reviewing past and existing portfolios, analyzing potential ways to enhance engagement, and exploring opportunities for financial and technical support to scale up SGP innovations. The SGP also plans to engage with the private sector by fostering public-private partnerships and other means, and by including mechanisms for engaging with the private sector through both targeted platforms and regular grant projects. Furthermore, the SGP will expand its innovative CSO-Government Dialogue Platform toward greater engagement of the private sector to leverage its potential to invest and support sustainability at the local level, including businesses relating to tourism, agriculture, forestry, and other relevant sectors. These platforms will provide opportunities to discuss possible shifts in relevant policies and practices to promote sustainability. The private sector is also expected to be fully engaged in fostering partnerships with the private sector and other CSOs to explore innovative, affordable, and practical solutions to chemicals and waste management while establishing systems of local producer and/or product certification as an initial step toward expanding to producer-consumer agreements. In the climate change thematic area, the role of the private sector and CSOs is critical in ensuring the sustainability and affordability of low carbon technologies promoted at the community-level, and similarly, private sector partnership and support will be crucial to delivering the GEF-7 SGP Strategic Initiative on catalyzing sustainable urban solutions. In the biodiversity thematic area, SGP projects will explore opportunities to engage with civil society networks and the private sector in supporting community-based eco-tourism activities to generate incentives to local communities for managing and conserving biodiversity. SGP country programs will also explore opportunities to link smallholder producers and pastoralists to markets and technologies. Finally, under the chemicals thematic area, SGP country programs will work with other national and local stakeholders to identify and support exploration of incentives for civil society involvement to sustainably eliminate chemicals."
"10442"," The private sector will be engaged in the project through a capacity building program aimed at expediting the implementation of the national ABS framework. This program will focus on strengthening the institutional capacity of government and private sector agencies. The project also aims to establish a comprehensive communication and sensitization strategy, which will include pillars related to communication on the procedures established under the new ABS regulatory framework and stakeholder participation. The private sector may be involved in these aspects, particularly in the formulation and/or revision of regulatory and administrative tools, codes of conduct, and model contractual clauses, as well as in their operationalization and decision-making processes pertaining to access to genetic resources and traditional knowledge. However, the specific level of private sector involvement is not explicitly stated in the context information."
"10429"," The private sector is involved at the level of 'Policy Development' and 'Capacity Development'. In terms of Policy Development, the private sector is consulted as part of an intervention to develop policy products, including regulations, frameworks, and policy reports. They may be included in steering or advisory committees. In terms of Capacity Development, the private sector is the recipient of capacity-building initiatives aimed at enhancing their ability to perform core profit-generating activities. This includes training and support in areas such as climate information and investment opportunities related to the environment. Private sector representatives may also be present in meetings or workshops organized by the project, but their views and perspectives are not considered in informing policy discussions."
"10373"," The private sector is significantly involved in the project, predominantly building on and enhancing private sector initiatives. Private sector entities from various priority sectors, including but not limited to the electrical power sector, waste generators, and municipal and hazardous waste collection, management, recycling and disposal enterprises, will be engaged and consulted during the development and review of new/revised chemicals and waste related policies/regulations, industry incentives, and Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) framework. The project will also work with the private sector to conduct a detailed hazardous waste inventory, develop a web-based hazardous waste monitoring tool, engage in cleaner production practices, and introduce safer alternatives. Additionally, the project will engage with the private sector on the phase-out/replacement of PCB-containing/contaminated electrical equipment and the removal and disposal/treatment of PCB wastes and potentially the bio-remediation of one PCB-contaminated REG maintenance site. The private sector will also be involved in the removal, packaging, and disposal of obsolete POPs and non-POPs pesticides, as well as the collection and disposal of PBDE-containing plastic. Furthermore, the project will work with research institutes, universities, and private sector partners on assessing the potential for, and introducing, valorization of priority (hazardous) waste streams. This involvement aligns with Category 6, ""Industry Leadership,"" as the private sector is leading in proposing solutions and advancing the project by contributing financing, expertise, and directly participating in the development and implementation of the project's fundamental activities."
"10155"," The private sector will be consulted and involved in project design and implementation, deriving lessons from private-sector experience with Climate Change Adaptation/Climate Change Mitigation (CCA/CCM) actions and engaging the nascent Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) private sector at an early stage. The project will also engage non-AFOLU private sectors such as Dairy Unions, Farmers Association through MAIL; Energy and Mining companies, which will be coordinated through MoMP. This level of private sector involvement can be classified as ""Industry Leadership"" (Category 6), where the private sector not only contributes financing and/or expertise but also leads the development and implementation of ideas that constitute the fundamental activities of the project."
"10358"," The project engages the private sector in several ways, indicating a significant level of involvement. This includes direct financial contributions from private sector entities, as well as their participation in various aspects of the project's design and implementation. The private sector is expected to benefit from the project's activities, such as the development of business and financial schemes, which should be instrumental for developing market strategies. Private bus operators will benefit from the project's demonstration and other supporting actions to transition towards electric vehicles in their fleets. Owners of private fleets, including companies in sectors such as urban delivery, car rental, and taxi, will also benefit from the project's demonstration and supporting actions. Furthermore, most of the capacity-building activities included in the project are targeting private sector entities. This comprehensive involvement suggests that the private sector is playing a substantial role in this project, falling under Category 5 and partially Category 6, as they contribute financing, expertise, and leadership in certain aspects of the project."
"10251"," The private sector is engaged in the project at the level of ""Finance."" This is evident through the co-financing provided by the private sector, which includes $100,000 in grants and $50,000 in-kind from FAO, as well as $103,400,000 from the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Land Reform. The private sector's contribution is not limited to routine expenses or general operational costs, but rather supports the project's interventions. However, the private sector does not play a leading role in the project's design and implementation, as it is not the initiator of the project's fundamental activities."
"10108"," The private sector is involved in the project, but the main activities will remain within the scientific and public sectors. Specifically, the private sector will be engaged in the design and execution of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) demonstration projects and in consultative processes for the Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis (TDA) and Strategic Action Programme (SAP). The private sector will also participate in policy dialogues and capacity building activities to promote sustainable practices. Additionally, nature-based tourism operators will participate in the TDA/SAP process and policy dialogues and will be trained in water efficiency and conservation. Coffee organizations, the Sugar Association, and other private sector entities will also be involved in various aspects of the project."
"10798"," The private sector is significantly involved in the project as outlined in the provided context. They are engaged in policy development through consultations for the formulation of policies, guidelines, and manuals. The private sector also plays a crucial role in capacity development, with the project assisting MSMEs in the healthcare sector, including TSDs and manufacturers of PPEs, in preparing feasibility studies or project proposals for technology adoption. Furthermore, the private sector is involved in finance, with the Development Bank of the Philippines establishing a loan facility for solid and hazardous waste management facilities and waste to energy projects, and the project helping TSD and PPE manufacturing enterprises prepare applications for financing institutions. The private sector's role in industry leadership is also evident as they are expected to introduce the manufacture of reusable non-medical fabric masks as an alternative to prevent additional wastes generation."
"10632"," The private sector is significantly involved in the project as stakeholders, participants in knowledge and information sharing, and contributors in policy development. They are consulted in the development of policy products, regulations, and frameworks related to the project. The private sector is also expected to participate in capacity development activities to enhance their ability to perform core profit-generating activities. Furthermore, the private sector is engaged with the project for finance and expertise, contributing to interventions initiated by another party.

Private sector representatives may also be included in steering or advisory committees, indicating their role in the governance of the project."
"10353"," The private sector is significantly involved in the project as outlined in the document excerpt. They are engaged in knowledge and information sharing, policy development, capacity development, and finance. In terms of knowledge and information sharing, the private sector is expected to contribute content to the Green Chemistry Innovation and Inclusion Network, demonstrating their expertise and successes. They will also participate in the network as mentors to more novice members. In the context of policy development, the private sector is consulted in the development of human capital for safer chemical substitution and is involved in drafting or influencing policy related documents. They are also engaged in capacity development, with the potential to apply for acceptance into the accelerator program to bring an innovation to market and contribute as trainers, mentors, or judges for the accelerator program. Furthermore, the private sector plays an essential part in contributing ideas for the business challenges and participates in developing solutions to the Innovation Challenge. Lastly, the private sector provides finance through co-financing support to the project activities and may also be a potential funder of a promising technology identified by the accelerator programme. Overall, the private sector's involvement in this project can be classified as ""Industry Leadership"" as they contribute financing, expertise, and lead the development and implementation of ideas that constitute the fundamental activities of each project."
"10466"," The project has a significant private sector engagement, as defined in Category 6 - Industry Leadership. This is demonstrated by the private sector playing a key role in the project, engaging in a multitude of different activities, from street infrastructure to bicycle renting, from waste management to sustainable tourism. The private sector was consulted during the project development grant phase and identified as key stakeholders during project execution. However, private sector co-financing was difficult to materialize at this stage of the project due to various factors. The project aims to leverage private sector investment through a dedicated working group (TWG3) and innovative public financing mechanisms, focusing on catalysing private sector investment in sustainable urban development."
"10626"," The private sector is involved at the ""Industry Leadership"" level in this context. This is evident in the project's Component 3, which focuses on innovative private sector engagement in the ABNJ. The project aims to facilitate the development of innovations in business operations, financing approaches, and partnerships that could help improve the state of marine biodiversity in the high seas. The GCP will engage diverse groups of private sector actors, including the fishing industry operating in ABNJ, major buyers of seafood originating from ABNJ, small businesses involved in collecting and recycling fishing gear or that develop new uses from previously discarded by-products of high-seas fisheries, relevant financial institutions, organizations that engage the shipping industry, organizations that represent other relevant marine business sectors and private sector actors relevant for other child projects. Two areas of private sector innovation envisioned are reducing marine debris originating from ABNJ fisheries and establishing a Fijian albacore fleet that is certified sustainable, adopts best-practices in terms of social and transparency dimensions and is supported with effective government policy and market rewards. Additionally, the project aims to achieve scale through broad communication targeting the private sector and financial institutions, with messaging focusing on the positive impacts on ABNJ being generated by participating innovators."
"10293"," The private sector will participate in relevant training sessions and multi-stakeholder dialogues on sustainable forest management and best logging practices. However, it seems there was no consultation with the private sector during project preparation, and their involvement in corresponding project activities is yet to be determined. The forestry private sector's engagement is planned for implementation starting from year 2 of the project, leaving enough time for engagement prior to implementation. An eco-tourism strategy will be developed, but no corresponding private sector actor is mentioned, consulted, or planned to be consulted. This activity has been removed from the logical framework to streamline project interventions and focus resources on higher impact activities."
"10427"," The private sector in this context is involved at the ""Policy Development"" level. They are consulted as part of an intervention to develop policy products, including regulations, frameworks, and institutional arrangements. Private sector representatives may be present in meetings or workshops organized by the project, but their views and perspectives are not considered in informing policy discussions. The private sector is also involved in outputs related to GHG inventories, tracking the implementation of the nationally determined contribution, and capacity building for climate transparency activities. They are expected to provide data, participate in training activities, and adopt CBIT deliverables. Additionally, they will be the national focal point for energy and solid waste sectors, ensuring the tracking of mitigation actions in these sectors."
"10246"," The private sector is significantly involved in the project as outlined in the context. They will be engaged across all components of the project and will have a key role in helping farmers to adopt new technologies, develop market linkages and supply chains. Mechanisms such as certifications, traceability platforms, eco-labelling, and value adding will be developed in collaboration with local SMEs, farmer enterprises, and cooperatives. Private sector cooperatives/enterprises in Hubei Province have committed to providing substantial self-financing of approximately 35% of Component 2 sub-project costs for the first year of investments. Additionally, Alibaba and other large e-commerce companies will be engaged for digital solutions that support sustainable production, including access to markets, monitoring of farmland for chemical residues and pest management, linking producers to consumers, and digital financial services. The private sector's engagement is not limited to financial contributions but also extends to capacity development, policy development, and industry leadership."
"10456"," The private sector is deeply involved in the project, playing a key role in its success. The project is designed in line with the GEF policy on Stakeholder Engagement, which sets out core principles and mandatory requirements for stakeholders. The private sector is a key source of co-financing, and the project management unit (PMU) will explicitly task the start-ups to connect with potential investors through various activities like Investor Connect, National Forums, and Global forums. The PMU will become a platform through which GCIP start-ups will be connected and establish relationships with a network of private investors, industry associations, venture capitalists, impact investors, and others.

The private sector is also engaged in the acceleration processes as mentors, trainers, and judges. Furthermore, the project aims to address some of the gaps faced by South African women green entrepreneurs by ensuring that a minimum of 35% of the total number of experts trained and GCIP-supported entrepreneurs will be women.

The project also plans to engage with industry and business associations to leverage their know-how, capital, and interest in cleantech innovations. For example, the project will build capacity of national industry associations in the acceleration of cleantech innovations and engage with industry experts as mentors, trainers, and judges in the acceleration processes.

Therefore, the private sector's involvement in this project falls under Category 6, ""Industry Leadership,"" as they are directly involved as leaders in proposing solutions and advancing the project. The private sector contributes financing and/or expertise and spearheads the development and implementation of ideas that constitute the fundamental activities of each project."
"10227"," The private sector is an important stakeholder in the project and will be engaged under component 3. Specifically, the project aims to strengthen the engagement and contribution of the business sector, including state-owned enterprises and private sector, through various arrangements. These arrangements include investigating the transparency status quo of enterprises in climate change actions, soliciting suggestions from enterprises and consulting agencies, enhancing transparency capacity building for enterprises, and establishing a sound reporting system and online database for corporate climate change actions. The project will also improve the transparency capacity building of enterprises by covering 2-3 key industries with 50-100 enterprises in each sector. The emission threshold for enterprise selection is above 50 kt CO2eq, resulting in a total of 150-200 enterprises trained from this project. The private sector's role as a financier is not explicitly mentioned, but they will be engaged as stakeholders and implementers of climate actions."
"10172"," The project has significant private sector engagement, with several outputs in the Results Framework involving work and collaboration with the private sector in sustainable agricultural production. There are 24 private sector entities identified as stakeholders in the Sixaola river basin, ranging from large international companies to medium and small producer cooperatives and associations. The private sector is also critical for strengthening existing traditional agroforestry systems based on limited external inputs, organic and endemic varieties. The project includes a Stakeholder Engagement Plan that details the role of the private sector in the project."
"10220"," The private sector is significantly involved in the project, participating at the policy development and capacity development levels. Specific private sector entities, such as Grupo Jaremar de Honduras, Rikolto / Cacao Producers, Industrial Association of Palm Oil Producers, Honduras (AIPAH), Palmas Centroamericanas, S.A. de C.V. (PALCASA), and Association of Ranchers and Farmers, have been identified as stakeholders. They have actively participated in project-related events, workshops, and bilateral meetings. The private sector will continue to be engaged during the implementation phase through their participation in regional and local platforms for training and workshops related to the identification of stakeholders interested in implementing low emission territories (LMTs) and signing conservation/restoration/best production practices agreements. Additionally, private sector stakeholders will receive technical support for mainstreaming biodiversity into production landscapes and promoting sustainable production of palm oil and basic grains, including financial and legal aspects to access credit and support RSPO certification using the RSPO Independent Smallholder Standard."
"10204"," The private sector is significantly involved in the project as outlined in the document excerpt. The project strategy includes introducing public and private financing, with a private investment guarantee facility secured via Rabobank in collaboration with USAID. This guarantee will be offered to participating project companies and/or cooperatives, securing a minimum of $5,000,000 in private investment. Additionally, two private sector partners, Tata Consumer Products Ltd and Rabobank India, will be invited to sit on the project steering committee. Private sector partners will also be engaged at a landscape level, with interaction ensured through participation on mechanisms such as multi-stakeholder landscape management bodies.

Private sector companies, particularly in the coffee sector, are actively investing in securing their future supply of raw materials while reducing their carbon footprint and removing deforestation from their supply chains. The project aims to leverage these private sector investments and commitments to promote sustainable agricultural practices and landscape management.

In summary, the private sector's involvement in this project can be classified under Category 5 (""Finance"") and Category 6 (""Industry Leadership""). The private sector is contributing financing and expertise to interventions initiated by another party (Category 5), and is also leading the development and implementation of ideas that constitute the fundamental activities of the project (Category 6)."
"10234"," The private sector is involved in the project at multiple levels, including policy development, capacity development, and finance. In terms of policy development, key tourism private sector associations have been closely engaged during the PPG phase and consulted on the proposed project design and opportunities for the project to strengthen tourism resilience in Bhutan. These associations will be engaged in the development of key ecotourism policy inputs such as the Ecotourism Master Plan and ecotourism safeguarding guidelines, and have a role in supporting private sector (e.g tour operators, tour guides, handicrafts sector, hotels and restaurants) in the demonstration landscape and in raising awareness. The project will also offer support to the private sector to mainstream biodiversity conservation into its operations, and the tourism sector at national and landscape levels are included within the beneficiaries of the project. In terms of capacity development, the project will establish and complete training of trainers, helping to create an ongoing training mechanism and a critical mass of trainers within the TCB and its network that will continue after the project ends. The project will also embed project-developed ecotourism modules into training programmes of the Royal Institute for Tourism and Hospitality and Ugyen Wangchuck Institute for Conservation and Environmental Research (UWICER). In terms of finance, the project targets aim to reach 5,550 (3,128 female) private sector personnel at national level and an additional 227 (152 female) with the demonstration landscape as direct beneficiaries. The first level of private sector engagement during project implementation will include local individuals or youth or community groups who will participate in the management of the demonstration ecotourism products of the project. The second level will include private individuals or firms from beyond the project demonstration landscape who can be engaged in the commercial operation of or investments into ecotourism products and services within the demonstration landscape. UNDP private sector due diligence processes will be adhered to for all project private sector partnerships, including potential co-financers."
"10267"," The private sector is significantly involved in the project, with multiple initiatives and partnerships established. At a high level, the private sector is contributing to the project through co-financing, expertise, and direct engagement in project activities.

4. Finance: The private sector is contributing financing and/or expertise to interventions initiated by another party, such as the partnership between Swire Shipping and PNG Power for clean-up and disposal costs of transformer oil.

5. Industry Leadership: Swire Shipping is leading a private sector consortium to dismantle, ship, and recycle ELVs on a commercial basis, demonstrating industry leadership in proposing solutions and advancing the project.

In summary, the private sector is involved in this project at multiple levels, including co-financing, knowledge sharing, capacity development, finance, and industry leadership."
"10452"," The private sector is involved in the SCIP (Sustainable Cities Integrated Approach Pilot) project at several levels. Firstly, the project aims to engage with private sector groups through existing business networks such as WBCSD, the Confederation of Danish Industries, the European Business Council for Africa, and innovative global consulting firms in urbanism like ARUP, WSP, Ramboll, COWI, AECOM, and Cardno. These private sector companies are expected to bring their expertise in integrated and sustainable urban planning solutions to the table.

Secondly, the SCIP Forum will host high-level investment roundtables where the Global Platform will bring together key international financial institutions, private sector companies, and cities to assess the investment potential of sustainable infrastructure projects. The private sector will be encouraged to participate in these roundtables to invest in sustainable infrastructure projects.

Thirdly, the SCIP project will promote Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) between cities and businesses to accelerate the deployment of new technologies and innovations such as renewable energy, clean mobility, and advanced waste management. The Global Platform will provide training, tools, and resources to support the development of PPPs through the Regional City Academies. Additionally, the Global Platform will seek to nurture public-private sector collaboration initiatives at the global and local level based on concrete demands from SCIP cities.

Fourthly, the SCIP project will connect cities to Project Preparation Facilities (PPFs) or relevant potential urban investors through matchmaking, such as regional development banks and the private sector. The Global Platform will work with the private sector to promote best sustainable practices by partnering with initiatives such as the City-Business Climate Alliance to promote dialogue and target setting between private sector and city partners.

Lastly, the private sector is involved in the Partnership Engagement Group (PEG), which is the external coordination mechanism of the SCIP GP. The PEG will include key global actors, initiatives, alliances, and networks in the urban development space, including private sector networks and cities. The PEG will provide inputs to the program about key trends, thematic areas, and approaches shaping implementation of the program and will establish a multi-stakeholder coalition of key urban actors, urban initiatives, alliances, and networks around common actions and jointly implemented activities on integrated urban planning or investments related to global environmental benefits.

Therefore, the private sector is involved in knowledge and information sharing, policy development, capacity development, finance, and industry leadership in the SCIP project."
"10228"," The private sector is involved in the project at the level of ""Industry Leadership."" This is evident from the fact that they will be actively engaged in the planning and implementation of the National ABS Strategy and Action Plan, including exploring linkages between ABS and various themes, facilitating dialogue amongst stakeholder groups, and developing partnerships with the private sector based on potential royalties and other benefits from bioprospection and commercial agreements using South Sudanese genetic resources. The private sector's role is not limited to knowledge and information sharing or policy development, but extends to leading the project's design and implementation, making this a Category 6 involvement."
"10117"," The private sector is involved at multiple levels in the project described in the document excerpt. They are engaged as beneficiaries of technical assistance and investment support, particularly in the hotel, tourism operators, waste collecting operators, and energy sectors. Additionally, the private sector is involved as partners, with the Chamber of Hotels, Chamber of Diving and Water Sports, selected hotels, and the Solid Waste Management Operator and Egyptian Hotel Association with member hotels acting as co-financiers. The private sector's engagement also includes direct involvement in the project through the implementation of pilot and demonstration activities to promote success stories in green hotel practices and public sector within Sharm El-Sheikh."
"10316"," The private sector is a strategic stakeholder and will be involved in the project as reflected in the SEP (Stakeholder Engagement Plan). It plays a very important role in governance and management of genetic resources for effective implementation of the ABS (Access and Benefit Sharing) mechanism. Specific private sector entities, such as IMRA, Homeopharma, and the JCR group, will be actively engaged during project implementation. The private sector will be involved in discussions and development of strategies for PIC (Prior Informed Consent) and MAT (Mutually Agreed Terms), and will also be key participants in the delivery of awareness, communication, and capacity building campaigns. The private sector in Madagascar has created a professional membership group, Fivondronan'ny Mpandraharaha Malagasy (FIV.MPA.MA), to promote effective participation of its members in the Malagasy economy and social sector. Two representatives of the private sector will be selected to the Project Steering Committee. Therefore, the private sector involvement in this project can be classified as ""Industry Leadership"" as per the given definitions."
"10151"," The project does not explicitly mention direct involvement of the private sector in the project activities. However, it does mention that the private sector, specifically smallholder animal farmers, are the main stakeholders in the project areas. The project aims to work with these smallholder farmers, providing them with technical assistance and capacity building to improve their livestock production and vineyard/vegetable production. The project also aims to engage with these farmers in the development and implementation of gender-responsive strategic and operational pasture management plans. Therefore, the private sector engagement in this project can be classified under Category 4: Capacity Development. The project is aimed at building the capacity of private sector actors, specifically smallholder farmers, to perform their core profit-generating activities related to livestock and crop farming."
"10260"," The private sector is involved in the project at the capacity development level. Specifically, the private sector, through Business Mauritius, will support the outputs under component 1 when needed, to develop the site visit program and facilitate the coordination between stakeholders. Additionally, private sector companies such as Independent Power Producers (IPPs), Omnicane, and other businesses will work with the project preparation team, MCIA, and UoM to develop a data collection and site visit program for the calculation of Tier 3 emission factors for their fossil fuel thermal power plants. Furthermore, the private sector, through the Mauritius Renewable Energy Agency (MARENA), will work with the CEB to develop a real-time weighted-average grid emission factor from the thermal power stations, bagasse plants, hydro-power plants, and wind and solar farms."
"10479"," The private sector is anticipated to be involved in the project, as mentioned in the context. However, specific details regarding the private sector actors to be involved, including associations, have not been provided. The project includes private sector organizations in Annex 9, and they will have a role in the project's implementation. The private sector's role is not explicitly defined as falling into any of the six levels of private sector involvement (No private sector involvement, Knowledge & Information Sharing, Policy Development, Capacity Development, Finance, or Industry Leadership) mentioned in the question. The context suggests that the private sector will contribute financing and/or expertise to interventions initiated by another party, which aligns with Category 5 (Finance). However, without more specific information, it is not possible to definitively place the private sector involvement in this project into one of the six categories."
"10437"," The private sector involvement in the provided context can be categorized as ""Industry Leadership"" (Category 6). This is due to the following reasons:

1. The project is being executed by Willis Towers Watson (WTW), a private sector company, which has a proven track record in designing, implementing, and supporting public-private collaboration to address large-scale challenges of risk.
2. WTW is responsible for developing and implementing novel, sustainable insurance products and programs, leveraging public-private collaboration, and supporting ecosystem resilience.
3. WTW has strong private sector relationships in the Pacific, working with local Pacific insurance companies and the regional risk pool, PCRIC, and is linked into ongoing insurance initiatives across the Pacific region.
4. The project strategy involves engaging with local insurance providers as distributors and administrators of community-level insurance programs, embedding the project outcomes into the local private sector, and supporting its long-term sustainability.
5. Local insurance marketplace engagement includes the insurance associations of Fiji and PNG, as well as local companies, indicating that the private sector is taking a leading role in the project."
"10435"," The private sector is deeply involved in the project as it is central to the project's design and implementation. The project is dedicated entirely to working with small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the private sector. Participating adaptation-SMEs will be the focus of the training and capacity-building program of the AAP; the AAP will provide funding to a selection of SMEs to further support their growth and development and increase their ability to attract investment from other sources. The AAP will also engage private sector investors to link them to adaptation-SMEs in Liberia and Madagascar. The project's identification of priority sectors, SME cohort selection processes, and curriculum development will also be informed by the private sector strategies reflected in Liberia and Madagascar's NAPAs, NAPs, and NDCs.

Additionally, the project will require measures to ensure that SMEs comply with the safeguards requirements that apply to the project. The AAP will incorporate CI-GEF Agency ESMF requirements into its selection criteria for cohort participation and for eligibility for accelerator grants. All participating SMEs will be required to adhere to the ESMF, and to develop risk mitigation strategies.

Therefore, the private sector involvement in this project can be classified under Category 6, ""Industry Leadership,"" as the private sector not only contributes financing and/or expertise but also spearheads the development and implementation of ideas that constitute the fundamental activities of the project."
"10446"," The private sector is involved in the project at the policy development and capacity development levels. In terms of policy development, the private sector is consulted as part of an intervention to develop policy products, including regulations, frameworks, and policy reports. Private sector representatives may be present in meetings or workshops organized by the project, but they are not consulted or their views and perspectives are not considered in informing policy discussions. In terms of capacity development, the project aims to build the capacity of private sector actors to perform their core profit-generating activities. Specifically, the project will provide training to the private sector on data sharing and the use of application tools. The private sector is not involved in the project at the knowledge & information sharing, finance, or industry leadership levels."
"10195"," The project involves private sector engagement in several ways, indicating a level of Category 6 involvement, where the private sector leads in proposing solutions and advancing the project. This is evident in the following ways:

1. The project aims to encourage the financial sector to develop more aimed at stimulating innovative financial instruments for investment into land management activities, specifically as it relates to sustainable and climate-smart agriculture.

2. The project will mobilize the Private Sector to enhance cooperation and explore the enabling environment they need to provide more investment in land management issues in the region.

3. The project will design bankable projects which could be considered by private funds for financing, and resources will be allocated to enable the PISLM to finance the development of proposals aimed at developing LD investment projects for possible financing by these Funds.

4. Consultations will be facilitated between the participating Governments and the banking system to put schemes in place to target, support and attract youth to get involved in sustainable climate-resilient agriculture as a post-COVID-19 strategy.

5. Linkages will be built with the private sector, in particular with the banking system and incentives put in place to encourage more investment to be directed to sustainable land management.

These points demonstrate that the private sector is not only consulted or informed about the project, but they are directly engaged in leading and financing various aspects of the project, making this a Category 6 involvement."
"10746"," The private sector is involved in the project at the level of ""Finance."" This is evident in the engagement of a private sector PES subproject developer to co-execute Output 3, which includes forest carbon activities. The private sector buyer will provide finance raised from the sale of carbon credits to cover project implementation costs and to compensate landowners for opportunity costs. Additionally, a private sector project developer will be engaged to raise private sector capital to co-finance project replication beyond the inception project sites. The private sector will also contribute to a fund for catchment management, in return for mitigating their business risk associated with water supply and climate risk."
