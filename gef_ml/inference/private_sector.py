This file contains the logic determining whether a given project has involvement with the private sector.

Levels of private sector involvement:
- 1: No private sector involvement - Projects which do not involve the private sector
- 2: Knowledge & Information Sharing - Projects in which the private sector is informed of initiatives and results
- 3: Policy Development - Projects where the private sector is consulted as part of an intervention run by someone else
- 4: Capacity Development - Projects focused on building the capacity of private sector actors, especially SMEs
- 5: Finance - Projects where government or civil society engages with private sector for finance and expertise
- 6: Industry Leadership - Projects that focus directly on the Private Sector as leader (private sector coming up with solutions; not only trained/capacitated)
